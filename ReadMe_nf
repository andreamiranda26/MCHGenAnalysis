## Introduction

This is a project to analyze the caribou population in the Southwest Alaska. The data was collected by Andrea Miranda Paez and her team. The data is stored in the `data/` directory. The analysis is stored in the `analysis/` directory.

## Data

### Samples

Raw fastq files are located in the `data/raw/` directory as symbolic links to the original files.

### Reference genome

Genome assembly **mRanTar1.h1.1** of _Rangifer tarandus_ was used as the reference genome. It is stored in the `data/reference/` directory.

## Analysis

### RAD-seq Nextflow pipeline

The RAD-seq pipeline was used to analyze the data. The pipeline is stored in the `radseq/` directory.

To appropriately run the pipeline on Easley using slurm and the correct queues, a custom configuration file was created and placed as `radseq/conf/custom.config`. The file contains the following:

```groovy
process { 
    executor="slurm"
    queue="jrw0107_std,general,nova"
}
```
Set up was done as follows:

```bash
# Create nextflow mamba/conda environment

mamba create -n Nextflow nextflow graphviz ncbi-datasets-cli gzip

# Activate the environment

mamba activate Nextflow

# Download the pipeline

nextflow clone nf-core/radseq -r dev
```

To run the pipeline, the following command was used through a bash script `nextflow/runMe_Nextflow.sh`:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

module load gcc/4.8.5
module load squashfs/4.4
module load singularity/3.8.4
